//! Watcher implementation for Darwin's FSEvents API
//!
//! The FSEvents API provides a mechanism to notify clients about directories they ought to re-scan
//! in order to keep their internal data structures up-to-date with respect to the true state of
//! the file system. (For example, when files or directories are created, modified, or removed.) It
//! sends these notifications "in bulk", possibly notifying the client of changes to several
//! directories in a single callback.
//!
//! For more information see the [FSEvents API reference][ref].
